  Based on traditional British motorcycle jackets, our Touring jacket is designed for a rugged & resilient look. Made from 8 oz. waxed cotton from British Millerain, the jacket is wind, water, & weather-resistant and made to withstand the elements. The military-inspired design features 4 spacious front pockets with snap closures, with a throat latch and removable belt. There’s also a detachable zip-out waistcoat for additional warmth and 3-in-1 functionality. Wear one with a chunky sweater and dark wash denim.
